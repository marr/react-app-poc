This repo was created with create-react-app@1.3.0. According to the
documentation, `.env` files are supported to set Environment Variables.

This is a case where I set REACT_APP_FOO=1 in both .env and on command line, but
the environment is not set in my `process.env` value during my builds.

Please help,
       Dave
